# football-app

This is a 5-a-side football team randomiser. Its purpose is to quickly give managers trully randomised teams.

I have added screenshots of the app inside the screenshots folder located within this git repo.

For best results to run this app I would surgest running this on your mobile device. 

To run this on your mobile device git clone this repo into a suitable folder located on your pc.
copy and paste the below code into your terminal or command line.
( git clone git@github.com:kalumshort/football-app.git )

once this is succsesfully cloned you should cd into the newly cloned folder, once you have gone into this new 
folder you should run
( npm install )
This will download all the needed packages for you to run this app correctly.

After you have downloaded all the packages you need I would now suggest downloading the expo mobile app 
so you can run this using your mobile. The app is on on the app store for apple and also the google play store 
for android.
The app is called Expo and is pubplished by Expo Project.

Once you have the mobile app downloaded you should be all set to view the app on you mobile.
Firstly cd so that you are inside the newly cloned folder, Once there you will need to type
( npm start )
This should begin the start up process to run this app.
Once this is done it should present you a QR code.

If you have an iPhone:
Open to the camera app and point the camera at the QR code.
A notification should appear at the top of the screen, asking if you want to open the link in the Expo app. (Note that you must have iOS 11 or later for this to work).
Tap the notification, the Expo app will open and will begin to load your app.

If you have an Android phone:
Open the Expo app and tap the 'Scan QR code' link.
Point the camera at the QR code. It will scan and open your app.

If your using a windows computer you may be unable to access the development server.
This happend for me but its quite a easy fix. With me i needed to reassign my virtualbox network interface.
If you follow the link below its what I used to fix the problem.

If that didnt work you may also need to change some firewalls. This wasnt a problem i faced but with the link below 
it should walk you through how to fix the problem.
